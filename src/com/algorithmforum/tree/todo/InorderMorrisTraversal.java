/**
 *
 * Using Morris Traversal, we can traverse the tree without using stack and recursion.
 * The idea of Morris Traversal is based on Threaded Binary Tree.
 * 
 * In this traversal, we first create links to Inorder successor and print the data using these links,
 * and finally revert the changes to restore original tree.
 *
 * 1. Initialize current as root 
 * 2. While current is not NULL 
 * 		If current does not have left child
 * 			a) Print currentâ€™s data
 * 			b) Go to the right, i.e., current = current->right
 * 		Else
 * 			a) Make current as right child of the rightmost node in current's left subtree
 * 			b) Go to this left child, i.e., current = current->left
